File/Signature version 1.009
============================

NAME
    File::Signature - Detect changes to a file's content or attributes.

ABSTRACT
    This perl library uses perl5 objects to assist in determining whether a
    file's contents or attributes have changed. It maintains several pieces
    of information about the file: a digest (currently only MD5 is
    supported), its inode number, its mode, the uid of its owner, the gid of
    its group owner, and its last modification time. A File::Signature
    object is closely associated with a single pathname. It provides a way
    to compare the state of a file over different points in time; it isn't
    useful for comparing different files.

OPERATING SYSTEMS

File::Signature uses stat() to get attributes about a file. This works on Unix
and "unix like" operating systems. I don't know if it will work on Windows. I
suspect it won't though.
